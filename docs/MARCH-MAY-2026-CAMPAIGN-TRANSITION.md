## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Carryover candidates forget about campaign during Feb break

**Mitigation:**

- Daily WhatsApp reminders
- Personal phone calls before Feb 10

### Risk: Performance Max underperforms due to audience fatigue

**Mitigation:**

- Fresh creative variations every 2 weeks
- Expand to new lookalike audiences
- Increase Google Search budget if needed
- Test new demographic targeting in Mar 16-31

### Risk: Learning curve with new campaign platform/CRM setup

**Mitigation:**

- Dry run all new processes Feb 23-29
- Train team on new workflows now
- Document all procedures before go-live
- Have backup manual processes ready

###Risk: Financing/payment plan delays at campaign start

**Mitigation:**

- Secure fintech partnership by Feb 15
- Have payment plan details ready by Feb 20
- Create financing calculator with 3 options
- Empower admissions team with payment authority
