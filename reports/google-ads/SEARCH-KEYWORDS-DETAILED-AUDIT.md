## 🔴 KEYWORDS TO PAUSE IMMEDIATELY (⚫ POOR - Zero Conversions)

### These keywords are destroying your CPA

| Keyword | Impressions | Clicks | Cost | CPA | Issue |
|---------|------------|--------|------|-----|-------|
| **"learn filmmaking online"** | 1,456 | 87 | $43.50 | ∞ | Wrong audience (hobbyists, not students) |
| **"free film courses"** | 789 | 102 | $30.60 | ∞ | Price shoppers - not serious |
| **"digital marketing course"** | 1,234 | 94 | $47.60 | ∞ | Completely wrong vertical |

**Total Waste**: $121.70 (ZERO conversions)

**Reason**: These keywords attract people looking for FREE or HOBBYIST content, not serious students ready to pay for a diploma program.

**Action**: PAUSE all three immediately.

## 🟠 KEYWORDS TO AUDIT & LIKELY PAUSE (🔴 LOW - Generic Terms)

### High volume, low intent - mostly low conversions

| Keyword | Impressions | Clicks | Conversions | Cost | CPA | Issue |
|---------|------------|--------|------------|------|-----|-------|
| **"film school"** | 2,840 | 185 | 2 | $92.50 | $46.25 | Too generic - people comparing schools |
| **"media course"** | 2,156 | 156 | 1 | $78.40 | $78.40 | Generic - huge cost per conversion |
| **"graphic design course"** | 1,890 | 134 | 0 | $67.20 | ∞ | Generic - zero conversions |

**Total Waste**: $238.10 (only 3 conversions from 475 clicks)

**Why They Fail**:
- "film school" = Someone searching ALL film schools (not ADMI specifically)
- "media course" = Researching options, not ready to commit
- "graphic design course" = Generic search with zero interest in ADMI

**Action**: Pause or add as negative keywords. If you keep them, you MUST create landing pages that explicitly say "ADMI is the only choice because..."

## 🟢 EXCELLENT KEYWORDS (HIGH INTENT - Keep & Expand)

### These are WINNING - increase bids immediately

| Keyword | Impressions | Clicks | Conversions | CTR | CPA | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|------------|-----|-----|--------|
| **"enroll film production diploma kenya"** | 234 | 45 | 3 | 19.2% | **$6.00** ✅ | SCALE THIS |
| **"graphic design diploma admission"** | 156 | 28 | 2 | 17.9% | **$4.20** ✅ | SCALE THIS |
| **"admi application form"** | 178 | 32 | 2 | 18.0% | **$4.80** ✅ | SCALE THIS |
| **"admi africa"** | 892 | 156 | 4 | 17.5% | **$7.80** ✅ | SCALE THIS |
| **"admi africa courses"** | 523 | 89 | 3 | 17.0% | **$11.87** ✅ | SCALE THIS |

**Why They Win**:
- **Action intent**: "enroll", "application", "admission" = ready to take action
- **Brand intent**: Searching for ADMI by name
- **Specific intent**: Asking for specific program, not generic "course"

**CTR Average**: 17.9% (vs 8.6% overall) - 2x better engagement

**Action**: 
- Increase bids by 20-30% on these keywords
- Allocate the $359.80 recovered budget to these winners
- Expected volume increase: +50% impressions on these keywords

## 🟡 GOOD KEYWORDS (Medium-High Intent - Keep & Monitor)

| Keyword | Impressions | Clicks | Conversions | CTR | CPA | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|------------|-----|-----|--------|
| **"film production diploma"** | 892 | 78 | 2 | 8.7% | $19.50 | Keep |
| **"audio engineering course nairobi"** | 645 | 51 | 1 | 7.9% | $25.60 | Keep |

**Why They're Good**:
- Specific program intent (not generic "course")
- Location-targeted (Nairobi)
- Converting but not as efficiently as excellent keywords

**Action**: Monitor performance. They're OK but not priorities for bid increases.

## 🟠 MEDIUM KEYWORDS (Location-Specific)

| Keyword | Impressions | Clicks | Conversions | Cost | CPA |
|---------|------------|--------|------------|------|-----|
| **"photography school kenya"** | 1,654 | 102 | 1 | $51.20 | $51.20 |

**Why It Underperforms**:
- Only 1 conversion from 102 clicks
- Generic "school" + location, but not specific enough
- Landing page probably generic homepage

**Action**: Create photography-specific landing page or pause.
