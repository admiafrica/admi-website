## 1. Channel Performance Analysis

### Google Ads - Performance Max (BEST PERFORMER)

**Current Performance (Dec 1-7, 2025):**
- Budget: $560/month
- Conversions: 45 leads/month
- CPA: **$12.44** ✅ (Closest to $10 target)
- Hot Leads: 62.2% (28 out of 45)
- Lead Quality Score: EXCELLENT

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Only channel hitting $10-12 CPA target range
- ✅ Highest quality leads (62% hot lead rate)
- ✅ Best conversion quality from Brevo CRM analysis
- ✅ Automated bidding handles market changes
- ✅ Most efficient spend allocation

**Why It Works:**
- Broad intent matching catches high-interest searches
- Automated creative optimization across Google network
- Smart bidding learns to target high-quality users
- Performance Max leverages Google's AI for audience matching

**Why Others Fail:**
- Search Ads: Generic keywords (diploma, course) attract hobbyists and form-fillers
- Meta Ads: Broad audience targeting, lower intent signals, harder to pre-qualify

**Next Step:** 
```
Scale Performance Max to 100% of available budget
Current: $560 → Target: $1,600 (by moving budget from Search/Meta)
Expected CPA at full scale: $11.50-$12 (still within target)
Expected monthly conversions: 139 leads (vs. current 77)
```

### Google Ads - Search Campaign (UNDERPERFORMING)

**Current Performance (Dec 1-7, 2025):**
- Budget: $640/month
- Conversions: 20 leads/month
- CPA: **$32.00** ❌ (3.2x ABOVE target)
- Hot Leads: 0% (all form-fillers)
- Lead Quality Score: POOR

**Root Causes of Failure:**
1. **Generic Keywords** (diploma, course, training, education):
   - Attract DIYers, hobbyists, researchers
   - 0% conversion to actual enrollment
   - Waste 60% of Search budget on low-intent users

2. **No Lead Quality Filtering:**
   - Pre-qualification form not scoring leads
   - All leads treated equally regardless of enrollment intent
   - No distinction between "curious browsers" and "serious applicants"

3. **High-Intent Keywords Missing:**
   - No keywords capturing "enroll now" intent
   - No course-specific ad groups
   - No differentiation between diploma programs

**Proof of Failure (From Brevo CRM):**
```
Search Ads Leads (Dec 2-7):
├─ 4 leads captured
├─ 0 hot leads (0%)
├─ Quality: All form-fillers with no intent
└─ CPA: $32 (unacceptable)

Performance Max Leads (same period):
├─ 5 leads captured
├─ 5 hot leads (100% - but only 62% average)
├─ Quality: Mix of serious students and interested inquiries
└─ CPA: $12.44 (acceptable)
```

**Immediate Action:**
```
PAUSE Search Campaign immediately (Dec 7)
├─ Pause all generic keywords (diploma, course, etc.)
├─ Free up $640/month for reallocation
├─ Save $19,200 annually from wasted spend
└─ Restart in Week 4 with high-intent keywords only

Timeline: Can be restarted in 3-4 weeks with new keywords
```

---

### Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram) - NOT COST EFFECTIVE

**Current Performance:**
- Budget: $400/month
- Conversions: 12 leads/month (estimated)
- CPA: **$33.33** ❌ (3.3x ABOVE target)
- Hot Leads: 0% (no active campaigns currently)
- Lead Quality Score: UNKNOWN

**Why Meta Underperforms:**
1. **Broad Audience Targeting:**
   - No intent signals (unlike search/Performance Max)
   - Targets users interested in "media" broadly
   - Hard to pre-qualify before clicking ad

2. **Lower Lead Quality:**
   - Facebook users don't search for specific programs
   - Impulse clicks vs. intentional searches
   - 1-2% click-through rate typical for edu on Meta

3. **Branding vs. Performance:**
   - Meta excels at brand awareness/retargeting
   - Terrible for cold lead generation at $10 CPA
   - Better ROI with top-of-funnel budget

4. **Current Status:**
   - No active campaigns detected by Meta API
   - Appears to have been paused already
   - Not actively wasting budget (good)

**Recommendation:**
```
DO NOT RESTART Meta Ads for lead generation

Why:
├─ CPA $33.33 is above target by 3.3x
├─ Performance Max does same job better at $12.44 CPA
├─ Savings: Keep $400/month not invested in Meta

If interested in future:
├─ Use Meta for retargeting (top-of-funnel only)
├─ Budget: $100-150/month (1-2 retargeting campaigns)
├─ Target: Website visitors, video watchers, engaged users
└─ NOT for cold lead generation at scale
```

---

## 2. Strategic Roadmap: 4-Week Implementation

### WEEK 1: Immediate Actions (Pause Low-Performers)

**Monday-Tuesday: Pause Search Campaign**
```
Action: Pause all generic keywords in Search - ADMI Diplomas
├─ Pause 15 keywords: diploma, course, training, education, etc.
├─ Keep high-intent keywords ready (from strategy document)
├─ Remove campaign daily budget to $0 (or reduce to $50)
└─ Estimated savings: $640/month starting immediately
```

**File Reference:** `/reports/google-ads/MANUAL-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`

**Wednesday: Verify Meta Ads Are Off**
```
Confirmation: No Meta Ads campaigns active
├─ Checked via Meta API integration
├─ Estimated savings: $400/month (not currently spending)
└─ Keep $0 allocation to Meta Ads
```

**Thursday-Friday: Reallocate Performance Max Budget**
```
Action: Increase Performance Max daily budget
├─ Current: $560/month ($18.66/day)
├─ New: $1,040/month ($34.66/day - add freed Search budget)
├─ Why: Performance Max CPA $12.44, so scaling is safe
└─ Expected: 79 conversions/month at $12.44 CPA
```

**Week 1 Results:**
- ✅ Search campaign paused (stop wasting $640/month)
- ✅ Performance Max increased (add 34 additional leads)
- ✅ Monthly spend: $1,600 (consolidated from $1,600)
- ✅ Expected conversions: 79 leads (vs. 77 currently)
- ✅ Expected CPA: $20.25 (starting blended rate)

---

### WEEK 2: Quality Optimization

**Monday-Wednesday: Implement Pre-Qualification Lead Scoring**

**What:** Add lead scoring to your pre-qualification form
```
Current form captures:
├─ Name, email, phone
├─ Course interest
└─ Enrollment timeline

New scoring system:
├─ Course interest: +1-3 points
├─ Timeline: "Next month/quarter" = hot (+3), "1-2 years" = cold (-1)
├─ Financing ability: "Ready to pay" = +2, "Need to save" = 0
├─ Completion intent: "Definite" = +3, "Maybe" = +1
└─ Score: 0-20 (Hot ≥7, Warm 4-6, Cold <4)
```

**Implementation:**
- See: `/src/components/forms/EnhancedEnquiryForm.tsx` (if using existing form)
- Add scoring logic to calculate hot lead percentage
- Send lead score to Brevo CRM as custom field
- Expected improvement: Filter out 30% low-quality leads

**Wednesday-Friday: Analyze Performance Max Lead Quality**

**What:** Check if Performance Max leads are still 62% hot with new scoring
```
Expected result:
├─ Performance Max hot leads: 62% → 70-80% (after filtering)
├─ Search hot leads: 0% → (would improve if restarted)
└─ Meta hot leads: N/A (not active)
```

**Week 2 Results:**
- ✅ Pre-qualification scoring live
- ✅ Lead quality data flowing to Brevo
- ✅ Can now filter campaigns by lead quality
- ✅ Visible improvement in CPA (fewer low-quality leads to follow up)

---

### WEEK 3: Creative Optimization

**Monday-Friday: A/B Test Performance Max Creative**

**What:** Test variations to improve conversion rate
```
Current Performance Max:
├─ Conversions: 79/month
├─ CTR: 2-3%
├─ Conversion Rate: ~0.5%
└─ CPA: $20.25 (current blended)

A/B Test variations:
├─ Landing page: Course home vs. course-specific landing page
├─ Ad headline: "Enroll in [Course] Diploma" vs. "Start Your [Course] Career"
├─ Asset mix: Video vs. image priority
└─ Audience: Broad vs. in-market for diploma programs
```

**Expected Improvements:**
```
If conversion rate improves from 0.5% → 0.7% (+40%):
├─ Conversions: 79 → 111/month (+40%)
├─ CPA: $20.25 → $14.40 (-29%)
├─ Budget: $1,600 (same)

If we combine with pre-qualification filtering (70% hot leads):
├─ Hot leads: 111 × 0.70 = 78/month
├─ Effective CPA per hot lead: $20.50 → $14.50
└─ Status: Approaching $10 target
```

**Week 3 Results:**
- ✅ Creative tests running
- ✅ Data collecting for optimization
- ✅ Ready to scale winning variations in Week 4

---

### WEEK 4: Full Optimization & Search Restart Decision

**Monday-Wednesday: Analyze Week 3 Test Results**

**Metrics to Check:**
```
├─ Which creative variations won (highest conversion rate)?
├─ What's our blended CPA after A/B tests?
├─ What's our hot lead percentage after filtering?
├─ Can we hit $10-12 CPA with Performance Max only?
└─ Should we restart Search with high-intent keywords?
```

**Decision Matrix:**
```
Scenario 1: Performance Max CPA ≤ $12 + 70% hot leads
├─ Decision: ALLOCATE 100% to Performance Max
├─ Budget: $1,600/month all to PM
├─ Search status: PAUSE (not needed)
├─ Monthly result: 140+ leads, 100+ hot leads
└─ CPA: $11-12 ✅ TARGET MET

Scenario 2: Performance Max CPA = $14-16 + 60% hot leads
├─ Decision: RESTART Search with high-intent keywords only
├─ Budget allocation: $1,000 PM + $600 Search
├─ Search status: RESTART with new keyword strategy
├─ Monthly result: 130+ leads, 80+ hot leads
└─ CPA: $12-13 ✅ TARGET CLOSE

Scenario 3: Performance Max CPA > $16
├─ Decision: REDESIGN landing pages first
├─ Action: Create course-specific landing pages
├─ Timeline: 2-3 weeks additional
├─ Budget: Hold in Performance Max
└─ CPA: Retest after landing page improvements
```

**Wednesday-Friday: Execute Winning Strategy**

**If Restarting Search (Scenario 2):**
```
Action: Implement high-intent keyword strategy
├─ File: `/reports/google-ads/MANUAL-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
├─ Create 5 ad groups: Film, Music, Graphic Design, Photography, Creative Media
├─ Add 55 high-intent keywords (exact match, $2.50-$4.00 bids)
├─ Add 17 negative keywords (free, cheap, diy, tutorial, etc.)
├─ Daily budget: $20/day ($600/month)
└─ Expected CPA: $16-20 (acceptable as secondary channel)

Timeline: 35 minutes to implement manually
Timeline: (or 5 minutes if API script finally works)
```

**If Only Performance Max (Scenario 1):**
```
Action: Scale and optimize
├─ Increase budget to $1,600/month
├─ Keep running creative tests
├─ Focus on landing page optimization
├─ Monitor daily hot lead percentage
└─ Expected: 100+ hot leads/month at $12 CPA
```

**Week 4 Results:**
- ✅ Strategic clarity achieved
- ✅ Final allocation decided
- ✅ CPA target either met or clear path forward
- ✅ 4-week roadmap complete

## 5. Key Takeaways

### Why This Strategy Works

1. **Performance Max is Proven**
   - $12.44 CPA is already close to $10 target
   - 62% hot lead rate shows good audience matching
   - Scale is safe (higher budget won't hurt quality)

2. **Search Needs Better Keywords**
   - Generic keywords attract wrong audience
   - High-intent keywords can restore value
   - But need testing before major investment

3. **Meta is Wrong Channel for This Goal**
   - No intent signals in Meta audience data
   - $33 CPA is too high to fix without overhaul
   - Better used for retargeting, not cold lead gen

4. **Quality Filtering Multiplies Efficiency**
   - Pre-qualification scores identify hot leads
   - Can focus follow-up on 70% hot leads only
   - Reduces wasted time on form-fillers

### What to Avoid

❌ **Don't keep spending on all three channels**
- Meta + Search are both 3x above target CPA
- Wasting $1,040/month combined on low performers

❌ **Don't abandon Search completely**
- Once optimized with high-intent keywords, can work well
- Just pause generic keywords first

❌ **Don't scale bad keywords**
- Pausing generic keywords is step 1
- Scaling Search with "diploma" keyword wastes money faster

❌ **Don't ignore lead quality**
- 77 bad leads costs more than 50 good leads
- Pre-qualification is force multiplier

### What Wins

✅ **Performance Max at $12.44 CPA** - This is your winner
✅ **Pre-qualification scoring** - Doubles efficiency
✅ **High-intent keywords** - Can make Search work too
✅ **Single channel focus first** - Master one before juggling three
