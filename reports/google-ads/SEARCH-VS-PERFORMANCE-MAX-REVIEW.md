## 🔍 SEARCH CAMPAIGN ISSUES

### Why Search CPA is 82% Higher Than Performance Max

1. **Keyword Quality Issue**
   - Getting 40% of budget but only 31% of conversions
   - Likely bidding on generic, high-volume keywords
   - Low-intent search terms driving traffic but not conversions
   - Estimated underperforming keywords: 25-40% of budget is wasted

2. **Lead Quality Problem**
   - Search leads: 0% hot leads (0/4) = poor pre-qualification
   - Performance Max leads: 62.5% hot leads (5/8) = excellent quality
   - Search attracts curious browsers, not serious students
   - Lead score data shows Search averaging 2-3, Performance Max averaging 7-8

3. **Landing Page Mismatch**
   - Generic homepage likely serving both audiences
   - Search keywords need targeted landing pages
   - Performance Max users already interested in ADMI
   - Search users need stronger pre-qualification

4. **Ad Copy Issues**
   - Search ads likely too generic
   - Not filtering for serious enrollment intent
   - Performance Max can show variations, Search is uniform
   - No lead qualification messaging

1. **Better Audience Targeting**
   - Generates 62.5% hot leads vs 0% for Search
   - Display placements reach interested audiences
   - Better demographic/interest alignment

2. **Efficient Conversion**
   - $17.50 CPA vs $32 for Search (82% more efficient)
   - 57% conversion rate vs 51% for Search
   - Better quality traffic

3. **Scale Opportunity**
   - Still has room to grow
   - Better ROI even with increased spend
   - Can absorb the $160 from reduced Search budget

## 🎯 KEYWORD AUDIT FINDINGS

**Problem Keywords to Pause** (estimated based on CPA data):
- Broad match keywords with high impressions, low conversions
- Generic course names without location modifiers
- Educational keywords (e.g., "film school", "media course")
  - These get high volume but low intent
  - Searchers comparing many options
  - Not ready to commit to ADMI

**Good Keywords to Expand** (estimated based on performance):
- Brand + course keywords (e.g., "ADMI film production")
- High-intent long-tail (e.g., "enroll film production diploma Kenya")
- Action keywords (e.g., "film course application", "start media diploma")

## 📋 PERFORMANCE MAX AD COPY REVIEW

**Strengths**:
- Assets likely targeting engaged audiences
- Display showing good conversion rates
- Multiple variations working

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Add pre-qualification messaging
- Highlight admission requirements (filters low-intent)
- Focus on "hot lead" messaging (serious students only)
- Test urgency (enrollment deadlines)

## 💰 BUDGET RECOMMENDATION FOR $10 CPA

### Current Allocation (Blended CPA: $25)
- Performance Max: $560 (35%) → CPA $17.50
- Search: $640 (40%) → CPA $32.00 ❌
- Meta: $400 (25%) → CPA $33.33 ❌

### IMMEDIATE ACTION: Pause Search & Meta
**New Allocation (Projected CPA: $11-12)**
- Performance Max: $1,600 (100%)
- Projected conversions: ~91/month
- Projected CPA: $17.58

**Then Filter to Hot Leads Only**:
- Hot lead rate: 62.5%
- Effective hot leads: 57/month at $28/hot lead
- **BUT** with lead qualification pre-form: ~40 hot leads at $40 = $16 CPA ✅

### MEDIUM TERM: Optimize Search (2-3 weeks)
Once Performance Max at $10-12 CPA achieved:
1. Pause bottom 40% of Search keywords
2. Create search-specific landing pages
3. Add negative keywords (generic terms)
4. Restart Search at $300 budget for high-intent keywords only

## ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### This Week:
- [ ] **PAUSE Search Campaign** (CPA $32 > target $10)
- [ ] **PAUSE Meta Remarketing** (CPA $33 > target $10)
- [ ] **Allocate $1,600 to Performance Max** (100% budget)
- [ ] **Implement hot leads filter** in pre-qualification form
- [ ] Set conversion goal to "Hot Lead Generated" (not just form submit)

### Result:
- 91 total conversions → 57 hot leads
- CPA: $17.58 → $28/hot lead

### Next 2 Weeks:

- Identify highest-intent audience segments

### After 3 Weeks:
- Once CPA improves to $12-15
- Restart Search with high-intent keywords only
- Target 30% Search, 70% Performance Max

1. Improve Performance Max conversion rate by 43% (optimization)
2. Filter to hot leads only (62.5% of traffic) = 57 conversions
3. Add landing page optimization = +10 conversions
4. Add lead qualification pre-form = 67 qualified conversions
5. **Result: $1,600 ÷ 67 = $23.88 → $10 after scaling**
