## 💡 WHY THESE KEYWORDS WIN

### High-Intent Keywords Attract:
✅ Students ready to enroll (not just curious)
✅ Searchers looking for diploma (not hobby learning)
✅ Location-specific (reduces unqualified traffic)
✅ Action-oriented ("enroll", "apply", "start")
✅ Course-specific (not generic "education")

### What You're Avoiding:
❌ "How to" searchers (DIY learners)
❌ Free course seekers (budget shoppers)
❌ Generic "course" researchers (early stage)
❌ Competitor/career researchers (not ready to buy)
❌ Hobbyist keywords (no conversion intent)

This is why Performance Max works better (CPA $17.50) - it naturally filters for serious students. With these keywords, Search will match that performance.
