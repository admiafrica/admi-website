### Task 1.1: Pause Zero-Conversion Keywords
**Deadline**: TODAY  
**Impact**: Save $121.70 budget immediately  
**In Google Ads**:
- [ ] Search "learn filmmaking online" → PAUSE
- [ ] Search "free film courses" → PAUSE

- [ ] Add negative keyword: "-beginner"
- [ ] Add negative keyword: "-amateur"
- [ ] Add negative keyword: "-hobby"
