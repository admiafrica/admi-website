## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Pin headlines strategically:**

   - Pin H1 (keyword headline) to Position 1
   - Pin H2 (intake/urgency) to Position 2
   - Let Google test remaining headlines

   - {Keyword:Default Text} capitalizes each word
   - Always provide default text for long keywords

3. **Monitor Quality Score weekly:**

   - Improve by matching ad copy to keywords

4. **Create custom landing pages:**

   - Each ad group should link to specific course page
   - Add intake dates prominently
   - Include clear CTA button

5. **A/B test ad copy:**
