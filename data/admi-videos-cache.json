It’s a turning point. In this conversation, Miss Shiko reflects on watching students transform from unsure and hesitant to prepared and confident. One student prepped so thoroughly that a panelist began texting a media contact mid-interview to ask if they could take him in.\n\nShe speaks about the power of reflection, the courage it takes for students to open up, and the quiet pride of seeing them thrive after graduation. Whether it’s hearing from parents about the change they’ve seen, or meeting alumni who say her lessons still guide them, these are the moments that stay with her.\n\nThis episode also highlights what makes ADMI different. From strong psychosocial support to lecturers who work in the industry, the experience is rooted in care, relevance and growth. If you’re a creative ready to take yourself seriously, this is where the shift begins.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

Employers were clear. Many graduates had the right academic skills but lacked the personal attributes that make someone dependable, adaptable, and ready. This course was created to change that. From the first semester, students begin learning how to manage time, relate with others, and understand themselves in a professional world.\n\nCiku Munuku has led this work since day one. A trained educator with a background in corporate and public relations, she stepped into teaching with curiosity and stayed because it felt like purpose. Her classroom is a space where students not only learn but also unlearn, reflect, and begin to believe they have something to offer. She teaches them to show up, speak well, and prepare with care.\n\nMany students experience Career Launchpad as a turning point. It helps them see themselves differently and understand their potential. They finish ready not just with technical skills but with confidence and practical tools that support their future success.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

In this conversation, he shares what it means to teach animation in a fully integrated creative ecosystem. From pre-production to final render, his classes cover every stage of the animation pipeline, blending technical skills with storytelling grounded in African identity. His teaching goes beyond software. It is about shaping visual thinkers who can direct, design, and animate with intention.\n\nHe speaks about his student Emanuel, who collaborated with peers to create an African version of a mythological character. That project led to the formation of a working group producing assets for international platforms like Sketchfab. For Benjamin, seeing students take ownership of their creativity and apply it in professional settings is the most fulfilling part of the job. These moments, where the student’s first creation becomes a lasting memory, are what he lives for.\n\nBenjamin reflects on the role of AI in animation, the importance of staying current, and why Africa needs its own creative trends. His story also includes a surprising personal detail. He nearly joined the military before choosing this path. Now, as an educator and 3D generalist, Benjamin Waithaka is part of a vibrant network of filmmakers, sound engineers, animators, and designers shaping the next generation of African storytellers.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

In this conversation, he shares what it means to teach animation in a fully integrated creative ecosystem. From pre-production to final render, his classes cover every stage of the animation pipeline, blending technical skills with storytelling grounded in African identity. His teaching goes beyond software. It is about shaping visual thinkers who can direct, design, and animate with intention.\n\nHe speaks about his student Emanuel, who collaborated with peers to create an African version of a mythological character. That project led to the formation of a working group producing assets for international platforms like Sketchfab. For Benjamin, seeing students take ownership of their creativity and apply it in professional settings is the most fulfilling part of the job. These moments, where the student’s first creation becomes a lasting memory, are what he lives for.\n\nBenjamin reflects on the role of AI in animation, the importance of staying current, and why Africa needs its own creative trends. His story also includes a surprising personal detail. He nearly joined the military before choosing this path. Now, as an educator and 3D generalist, Benjamin Waithaka is part of a vibrant network of filmmakers, sound engineers, animators, and designers shaping the next generation of African storytellers.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

But a chance encounter with early 3D software, a friend’s recommendation, and a visit to a small studio changed everything. In this interview, he shares how animation became a path not just to skill but to purpose.\n\nNow a lecturer, he’s committed to teaching more than software. He talks about the importance of collaboration across departments, connecting animators with sound designers, and preparing students for real-world work. He stays late to give feedback, follows industry trends closely, and wants each learner to leave as a full, thoughtful professional.\n\nHe’s worked on visualisations for national infrastructure, campaigns for wildlife, global brands, and new 3D screens in Nairobi. But his focus remains on the students. He believes digital content creation will shape the future economy and encourages parents to see creative careers as serious, valuable, and full of potential.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

With decades of experience in media and education, Sam shares how he mentors the next generation of creatives through focused training, industry insights, and honest conversations about what it takes to succeed. His background includes work with Standard Group and teaching at a private university, where he saw firsthand the demand for ADMI’s practical, skill-based approach.\n\nIn this interview, Sam reflects on how digital marketing and traditional marketing continue to work together, and why Gen Z students thrive in specialized learning environments. From photography and graphic design to copywriting and research, he explains why short, intensive programs are often better suited for students who already know what they want.

Years ago, someone she met at a workshop mentioned it, but it wasn’t her first option. When her dream school said no, she remembered that conversation and decided to give ADMI a chance. That decision changed everything.\n\nFrom the first report card, something shifted. For the first time, school felt like a place where she could thrive. The classes were structured in a way that made sense to her. The teachers took time to know her. And the environment encouraged her to figure out where she truly belonged in the world of art.\n\nSifa found herself in the work. She speaks about Mudbox, Maya, and After Effects with growing excitement. What started as a fallback became the place where she gained clarity, confidence, and a deeper love for animation.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

He came into teaching through a passion for sharing what he practices. His background as both an artist and a producer shapes his approach. Every lesson is built around real studio experience, current trends, and the kind of knowledge students can apply directly.\n\nIn this video, Kennedy Wathome shares what excites him about teaching and the moments that stand out in his classroom. He speaks about how discussing industry shifts with students, exploring new techniques, and guiding them through hands-on projects keeps the learning environment active and engaging. He recalls moments of pride when students present work that shows growth, creativity, and ownership.\n\nHis sessions are rooted in what is happening in music today. Whether it's a trending song or a new sound design method, Kennedy brings it into the room. He helps students link what they already know with practical skills and encourages them to move from ideas to finished projects. The goal is to build confidence, sharpen their craft, and prepare them to create on their own terms.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

From discovering the school during a high school expo to completing a professional certificate in graphic design, his journey is filled with growth, creativity, and community. He talks about the teachers who’ve made a lasting impact, especially Mr. Isaac, his photography teacher, who treats students like equals and makes the classroom feel welcoming.\n\nHe opens up about the challenges behind one of his proudest projects, a piece he created for the ADMI school festival. After struggling with creative block, the idea came to him late at night after watching anime. He worked nonstop from 1 a.m. to 1 p.m. to bring it to life. Seeing it featured on the festival poster made every moment worth it. For Arieh, learning at ADMI feels natural because it’s built around doing what you love.\n\nThis video also gives a glimpse into the unique culture of ADMI. Arieh talks about the ease of learning, the open classroom environment, and how the community makes it easy to connect with others. He reflects on how classes like Career Launchpad changed the way he thinks about work and how different creative subjects at ADMI are linked in surprising ways. Whether in class or on the patio, Arieh shows that ADMI is a place where students grow by being seen, supported, and inspired.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

In this conversation, she shares how she approaches teaching with empathy, adaptability, and a focus on practical skills. Her lessons are shaped by real-world projects and a commitment to making space for different kinds of learners.\n\nShe talks about how one-on-one sessions help her understand each student’s learning style. Whether someone is visual, neurodivergent, or needs more time to grasp a concept, she adjusts her approach to fit their needs. For her, teaching isn’t about perfection. It’s about helping students feel confident enough to try, mess up, and try again.\n\nManal also shares the industry work that informs her classes, from VR exhibitions to projects with National Geographic, Disney, and the BBC. Her hope is that by the time students leave her class, they feel more grounded in their creativity and more open to the process it takes to grow.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

It’s about helping students feel confident enough to try, mess up, and try again.\n\nManal also shares the industry work that informs her classes, from VR exhibitions to projects with National Geographic, Disney, and the BBC. Her hope is that by the time students leave her class, they feel more grounded in their creativity and more open to the process it takes to grow.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

What really matters is what students do with them. In this video, Karumba Ngatia shares how ADMI trains creatives not just to use equipment, but to create work that has impact.

In this video, faculty member Karumba Ngatia shares how he teaches students to approach their work with full commitment. He encourages them to see their projects as bigger than themselves, as work that could create lasting impact. This mindset helps students give their heart and soul to what they create, whether it’s a film, a design, or a sound project.\n\nNgatia explains that students often struggle when they realise what creative work actually involves. Some arrive with a bit of experience, and others come in expecting a simple process. What helps them move forward is a mental reset. He reminds them that they are young and malleable, and uses personal examples to help them reflect on how much they’ve already changed. Once that shift happens, students begin to engage with their work more seriously and with renewed purpose.\n\nThe video also highlights the kind of learner who grows fastest at ADMI. Students who enter with open minds and little experience often make the biggest leaps. The faculty, made up of part-time professionals who are active in the industry, support this growth by connecting real creative work to classroom learning.

There are active clubs on campus including the Production Club, Music Club, Muslim Club, and Christian Club. Each club is student-led with support from a faculty patron. They organize regular meetings, plan events, and build community.\n\nStudents take on real work while still in school. They handle event production for actual clients, take part in paid gigs, and build professional portfolios. Some of the events students have worked on include Nairobi Fashion Week, Miss Universe Kenya, TEDx Nairobi, and Open Cinema. On campus, all production work is handled by students. They manage sound, lighting, filming, live performances, and more. When ADMI needs marketing content, students are often involved in those shoots too.\n\nThe alumni network is large and active. Over 25,000 people have been trained, and over 4,000 have gone through the full campus experience. There is a dedicated platform for alumni to upload portfolios and connect with over 450 employer partners. Alumni take part in orientation sessions, speak at parent appreciation events, and stay closely involved with the community.\n\nADMI Cares is the social impact program that brings together students, faculty, and staff. They collect food, donate clothes, and visit children’s homes. These activities are done as a team and reflect the spirit of service that runs through the campus.\n\nThe environment is inclusive and creative. Students are encouraged to grow in their own way. Whether outgoing or reserved, everyone has a place to learn and build confidence. Faculty members are industry professionals who bring their expertise directly into the classroom.\n\nADMI’s core values are ambition, disruption, mission, inspiration, and fun. Every student, staff member, and faculty member is encouraged to live these values daily. The campus is designed to be a space where learning is engaging, creativity is supported, and everyone is welcome.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

At ADMI, learners are equipped with essential soft skills through the Career Launchpad program, where they practice communication, write professional emails, build strong CVs, and prepare for interviews. The program includes mock interviews with real HR professionals to help students feel confident in professional spaces.\n\nStudents also gain access to AI-powered employability training through our partnership with the Wadhwani Foundation, which introduces AI-led interview simulations and personalized learning tools. In addition to academic support from faculty and access to our digital learning platform, students benefit from one-on-one guidance, timely follow-ups, and structured wellness support through the student programs office and an on-campus counselor.\n\nEvery Friday, the campus transforms into a vibrant space for masterclasses, creative showcases, and meaningful conversations. Students also gain real industry exposure by participating in high-profile events like Nairobi Fashion Week, Miss Universe Kenya, and TEDx Nairobi, where they apply their skills in live projects and earn while learning.\n\nADMI creates a strong sense of belonging, consistency, and structure for every learner. With active student councils, leadership development, and opportunities to collaborate, students grow creatively, professionally, and personally. This episode offers a clear picture of how ADMI nurtures talent, builds character, and prepares students to thrive in today’s creative economy.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

      "description": "The song tells a story that stems from the Traditional African Society. \nAfter being rejected by a girl, the singer’s wish is to go back to the old days; where all a man needed to do so as to secure a wife was point at the girl he liked, and that was it! The parents of the bride received gifts and dowry in exchange for the girl, who had no choice but to comply. The instrumentation and message of the song define Africa and our culture.\n.\n.\n.\nThe project “Cultural and Creative Industries” is implemented by the GIZ on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and in cooperation with the Goethe-Institut. It improves employment and income opportunities for creative professionals in six partner countries; Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Kenya, Senegal, and South Africa and operates mainly in the music, fashion, design, and animation sectors. In addition to promoting the development of entrepreneurial, digital, creative, and technical skills through training programmes, the project aims to strengthen the framework conditions and the ecosystem of the cultural and creative industries.",
