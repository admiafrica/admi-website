What started as a casual session with friends turned into a frightening encounter with a rare strain of medicated weed—one that triggered a seizure in his friend and a terrifying hallucination he can only describe as “seeing Diablo.”\n\nThis experience pushed him into a spiral of anxiety, fear, and disconnection from reality. He was suspended from school multiple times, failed out of three different institutions, and had to restart high school under a new name just to survive the shame. For seven years, he drifted in and out of systems that didn’t understand what he was going through. But somewhere in the mess, he started to hear something different—a sound. Not in his head, but in the church, where he began to learn sound engineering and eventually found healing in purpose.\n\nThis is a story about losing your way and finding a new one. About drug-induced psychosis, school rejection, hidden identity, and the slow but steady rise to clarity. It’s about Papa Center, a safe space that showed him what support can feel like. It’s about using what broke you to build something better—for yourself and for others.\n\nWhether you’ve struggled with addiction, know someone who has, or just want to hear what real change looks like, this story will move you. Papa Billions is not here to impress you. He’s here to tell the truth.\n\nWatch, learn, and get inspired. This is not just school. This is ADMI.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

      "description": "Email: info@admi.africa\nCall/ WhatsApp: (+254) 711 486 581 / (+254) 706 349 696\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn this deeply personal episode, Nabeel recounts the unexpected moment he woke up in a rehab facility without warning. Taken against his will and left without a clear exit date, he had no choice but to adapt to a strict routine of counseling, group sessions, and isolation. The only constants were nicotine cravings, medication side effects, and an overwhelming sense of betrayal.\n\nHe walks us through the emotional toll of being left in the dark, not knowing when he’d leave, dealing with withdrawal, and trying to find a sense of control in a heavily policed environment. From trading meds with other patients to smuggled cigarettes, survival became a game of mental endurance and small rebellions.\n\nThis story sheds light on the complexity of addiction recovery, the blurred line between treatment and control, and what happens when healing is forced. If you’ve ever questioned what goes on behind the walls of a rehab centre, this episode doesn't hold back.\n\nWatch, learn, and get inspired. This is not just school. This is ADMI.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

      "description": "Email: info@admi.africa\nCall/ WhatsApp: (+254) 711 486 581 / (+254) 706 349 696\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn this raw and unfiltered episode of This Is ADMI, Papa Billions opens up about the moment everything changed. What started as a casual session with friends turned into a frightening encounter with a rare strain of medicated weed—one that triggered a seizure in his friend and a terrifying hallucination he can only describe as “seeing Diablo.”\n\nThis experience pushed him into a spiral of anxiety, fear, and disconnection from reality. He was suspended from school multiple times, failed out of three different institutions, and had to restart high school under a new name just to survive the shame. For seven years, he drifted in and out of systems that didn’t understand what he was going through. But somewhere in the mess, he started to hear something different—a sound. Not in his head, but in the church, where he began to learn sound engineering and eventually found healing in purpose.\n\nThis is a story about losing your way and finding a new one. About drug-induced psychosis, school rejection, hidden identity, and the slow but steady rise to clarity. It’s about Papa Center, a safe space that showed him what support can feel like. It’s about using what broke you to build something better—for yourself and for others.\n\nWhether you’ve struggled with addiction, know someone who has, or just want to hear what real change looks like, this story will move you. Papa Billions is not here to impress you. He’s here to tell the truth.\n\nWatch, learn, and get inspired. This is not just school.

He wanted to drop out of high school. While others chased grades and university dreams, he chased something different: music. In this honest and emotional sit-down, he opens up about rebellion, suicidal thoughts in primary school, and the pressure of growing up in a home that never felt whole.\n\nHis story isn’t just about weed, trumpets, or skipping class. It’s about what happens when a system doesn’t see you, and how music became his safe place, his reason to stay afloat. From sneaking into bands to faking his way onto the trumpet, to choosing practice over homework and clashing with rugby culture, Papa Billions reveals the chaotic, beautiful journey of a boy who never fit in and never stopped trying to find his voice.\n\nWhether you're a student, creative, or someone who’s ever felt left behind by traditional systems, this episode will strike a chord. Like, comment, subscribe, and share this with someone who needs to know it’s okay to choose a different path. This is more than a conversation. This is a reality check. This is ADMI.\n\nWatch, learn, and get inspired. This is not just school.

With credits alongside artists like Bensoul and Bien, he knows the creative process inside out. But for him, the real turning point came when he realized he could bridge the gap between technical knowledge and student understanding.\n\nAt ADMI, Hendrick teaches in both the Music and Sound and the Film and TV departments. His teaching style is deeply student-centered, starting each semester not with notes, but with conversation. He sees the classroom as a human space first, where creativity and connection build trust. That trust, he says, is what allows students to have their aha moments.\n\nEvery break, he revisits his materials to improve. Every class, he watches students transform theory into confidence. To Hendrick, teaching is not just about transferring knowledge. It’s about finding ways to understand better, explain more clearly, and keep learning alongside his students.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWatch, learn, and get inspired.

But a chance encounter with early 3D software, a friend’s recommendation, and a visit to a small studio changed everything. In this interview, he shares how animation became a path not just to skill but to purpose.\n\nNow a lecturer, he’s committed to teaching more than software. He talks about the importance of collaboration across departments, connecting animators with sound designers, and preparing students for real-world work. He stays late to give feedback, follows industry trends closely, and wants each learner to leave as a full, thoughtful professional.\n\nHe’s worked on visualisations for national infrastructure, campaigns for wildlife, global brands, and new 3D screens in Nairobi. But his focus remains on the students. He believes digital content creation will shape the future economy and encourages parents to see creative careers as serious, valuable, and full of potential.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

Years ago, someone she met at a workshop mentioned it, but it wasn’t her first option. When her dream school said no, she remembered that conversation and decided to give ADMI a chance. That decision changed everything.\n\nFrom the first report card, something shifted. For the first time, school felt like a place where she could thrive. The classes were structured in a way that made sense to her. The teachers took time to know her. And the environment encouraged her to figure out where she truly belonged in the world of art.\n\nSifa found herself in the work. She speaks about Mudbox, Maya, and After Effects with growing excitement. What started as a fallback became the place where she gained clarity, confidence, and a deeper love for animation.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

He speaks about how discussing industry shifts with students, exploring new techniques, and guiding them through hands-on projects keeps the learning environment active and engaging. He recalls moments of pride when students present work that shows growth, creativity, and ownership.\n\nHis sessions are rooted in what is happening in music today. Whether it's a trending song or a new sound design method, Kennedy brings it into the room. He helps students link what they already know with practical skills and encourages them to move from ideas to finished projects.

From day one, students are introduced to the fundamentals and gradually progress to complex, real-world projects. Whether it’s producing an album or setting up a live gig, the curriculum mirrors the actual demands of the music industry, step by step.\n\nWhat makes his classes stand out is the hands-on support he offers. Kennedy takes time to identify where a student is struggling, whether it's technical skills or understanding certain tools. He offers his personal contact, calls for one-on-one sessions, and follows up to ensure each learner feels seen and supported. His priority is to create a space where no one is afraid to ask questions or fail.\n\nKennedy believes that learning should not only be about acquiring skills, but also about living the experience. At ADMI, students are trained by professionals who are actively working in the field. This tight connection between classroom and career ensures that what’s taught is relevant and fresh. By the time students graduate, they don’t just carry a certificate—they carry real experience that speaks for itself.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

From discovering the school during a high school expo to completing a professional certificate in graphic design, his journey is filled with growth, creativity, and community. He talks about the teachers who’ve made a lasting impact, especially Mr. Isaac, his photography teacher, who treats students like equals and makes the classroom feel welcoming.\n\nHe opens up about the challenges behind one of his proudest projects, a piece he created for the ADMI school festival. After struggling with creative block, the idea came to him late at night after watching anime. He worked nonstop from 1 a.m. to 1 p.m. to bring it to life. Seeing it featured on the festival poster made every moment worth it. For Arieh, learning at ADMI feels natural because it’s built around doing what you love.\n\nThis video also gives a glimpse into the unique culture of ADMI. Arieh talks about the ease of learning, the open classroom environment, and how the community makes it easy to connect with others. He reflects on how classes like Career Launchpad changed the way he thinks about work and how different creative subjects at ADMI are linked in surprising ways. Whether in class or on the patio, Arieh shows that ADMI is a place where students grow by being seen, supported, and inspired.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

In this video, faculty member Karumba Ngatia shares how he teaches students to approach their work with full commitment. He encourages them to see their projects as bigger than themselves, as work that could create lasting impact. This mindset helps students give their heart and soul to what they create, whether it’s a film, a design, or a sound project.\n\nNgatia explains that students often struggle when they realise what creative work actually involves. Some arrive with a bit of experience, and others come in expecting a simple process. What helps them move forward is a mental reset. He reminds them that they are young and malleable, and uses personal examples to help them reflect on how much they’ve already changed. Once that shift happens, students begin to engage with their work more seriously and with renewed purpose.\n\nThe video also highlights the kind of learner who grows fastest at ADMI. Students who enter with open minds and little experience often make the biggest leaps. The faculty, made up of part-time professionals who are active in the industry, support this growth by connecting real creative work to classroom learning.

It begins with a thorough orientation where students meet faculty, IT support, finance teams, counselors, and student services. They’re introduced to tools like the learning management system and school email, and shown where to find help whenever they need it. Throughout their course, students engage in hands-on projects, attend gigs, and take part in industry events like Nairobi Fashion Week. Weekly activities such as Freshers Friday and open conversations create space for connection, growth, and creativity.\n\nAcademic support is available through accessible faculty, structured systems, and expert-led masterclasses, while mental wellness is prioritized through regular check-ins and events focused on emotional health. Students also have the chance to earn through paid client work and participate in vibrant campus clubs. From orientation to graduation, every step is designed to build confidence, skill, and industry readiness.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

At ADMI, learners are equipped with essential soft skills through the Career Launchpad program, where they practice communication, write professional emails, build strong CVs, and prepare for interviews. The program includes mock interviews with real HR professionals to help students feel confident in professional spaces.\n\nStudents also gain access to AI-powered employability training through our partnership with the Wadhwani Foundation, which introduces AI-led interview simulations and personalized learning tools. In addition to academic support from faculty and access to our digital learning platform, students benefit from one-on-one guidance, timely follow-ups, and structured wellness support through the student programs office and an on-campus counselor.\n\nEvery Friday, the campus transforms into a vibrant space for masterclasses, creative showcases, and meaningful conversations. Students also gain real industry exposure by participating in high-profile events like Nairobi Fashion Week, Miss Universe Kenya, and TEDx Nairobi, where they apply their skills in live projects and earn while learning.\n\nADMI creates a strong sense of belonging, consistency, and structure for every learner. With active student councils, leadership development, and opportunities to collaborate, students grow creatively, professionally, and personally. This episode offers a clear picture of how ADMI nurtures talent, builds character, and prepares students to thrive in today’s creative economy.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

In this interview, Ciku Munuku opens up about the lessons she’s learned in the classroom, the hidden strength of today’s youth, and why second chances matter. Her words are honest, rooted in experience, and deeply human.\n\nShe speaks of the young people she teaches with care and clarity. Not just as students, but as whole people.

It's a space where students are seen, guided, and held to a standard that believes in them.\n\nYou’ll walk away with insight into what makes ADMI different, what students need most, and why this generation has more potential than they’re often given credit for.

He came into teaching through a passion for sharing what he practices. His background as both an artist and a producer shapes his approach. Every lesson is built around real studio experience, current trends, and the kind of knowledge students can apply directly.\n\nIn this video, Kennedy Wathome shares what excites him about teaching and the moments that stand out in his classroom. He speaks about how discussing industry shifts with students, exploring new techniques, and guiding them through hands-on projects keeps the learning environment active and engaging. He recalls moments of pride when students present work that shows growth, creativity, and ownership.\n\nHis sessions are rooted in what is happening in music today. Whether it's a trending song or a new sound design method, Kennedy brings it into the room. He helps students link what they already know with practical skills and encourages them to move from ideas to finished projects. The goal is to build confidence, sharpen their craft, and prepare them to create on their own terms.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

      "description": "Email: info@admi.africa\nCall/ WhatsApp: (+254) 711 486 581 / (+254) 706 349 696\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this insightful conversation, Kennedy Wathome, a music production lecturer at ADMI, walks us through his unique approach to teaching. From day one, students are introduced to the fundamentals and gradually progress to complex, real-world projects. Whether it’s producing an album or setting up a live gig, the curriculum mirrors the actual demands of the music industry, step by step.\n\nWhat makes his classes stand out is the hands-on support he offers. Kennedy takes time to identify where a student is struggling, whether it's technical skills or understanding certain tools. He offers his personal contact, calls for one-on-one sessions, and follows up to ensure each learner feels seen and supported. His priority is to create a space where no one is afraid to ask questions or fail.\n\nKennedy believes that learning should not only be about acquiring skills, but also about living the experience. At ADMI, students are trained by professionals who are actively working in the field. This tight connection between classroom and career ensures that what’s taught is relevant and fresh. By the time students graduate, they don’t just carry a certificate—they carry real experience that speaks for itself.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

In this conversation, she shares how she approaches teaching with empathy, adaptability, and a focus on practical skills. Her lessons are shaped by real-world projects and a commitment to making space for different kinds of learners.\n\nShe talks about how one-on-one sessions help her understand each student’s learning style.

When he first arrived at ADMI, he was quiet and unsure of where he fit in. Coming from a background in business management, he didn’t yet know that creative education would be the turning point in his journey. It was the photography course that first caught his attention, but it was the support from faculty and fellow students that helped him settle into himself.\n\nAt ADMI, Francis found the space to grow and explore. Through film production classes, he discovered that leadership is not just about giving direction but about understanding people, ideas, and process. The school’s culture of support and student-led projects allowed him to test his ideas, take risks, and slowly step into his own voice. What began as a quiet passion for photography became a foundation for something much larger — a vision for student leadership shaped by community.\n\nThis is the story of a student who found his path at one of the leading creative colleges in Nairobi. In this conversation, Francis Simba shares how ADMI helped him grow into a role he never expected. For anyone considering film school, creative arts, or simply looking for a place that sees who you are becoming, his story is a powerful reminder that transformation doesn’t happen all at once. It starts with being seen.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica.",

What really matters is what students do with them. In this video, Karumba Ngatia shares how ADMI trains creatives not just to use equipment, but to create work that has impact. Whether it's through a mic, a lens, or a brush, students are challenged to produce art that means something and moves people.\n\nHe reflects on how departments collaborate, how students grow through real production timelines, and why it's important to talk to classmates outside your course. Karumba also speaks to the role of parents in a student’s journey. He encourages families to invest time, support, and belief. Two years of patience after graduation can make all the difference. Not every career starts fast, but steady growth is powerful.\n\nMore than anything, Karumba reminds students that what they create has the potential to live beyond them.

In this video, faculty member Karumba Ngatia shares how he teaches students to approach their work with full commitment. He encourages them to see their projects as bigger than themselves, as work that could create lasting impact. This mindset helps students give their heart and soul to what they create, whether it’s a film, a design, or a sound project.\n\nNgatia explains that students often struggle when they realise what creative work actually involves. Some arrive with a bit of experience, and others come in expecting a simple process. What helps them move forward is a mental reset. He reminds them that they are young and malleable, and uses personal examples to help them reflect on how much they’ve already changed. Once that shift happens, students begin to engage with their work more seriously and with renewed purpose.\n\nThe video also highlights the kind of learner who grows fastest at ADMI. Students who enter with open minds and little experience often make the biggest leaps. The faculty, made up of part-time professionals who are active in the industry, support this growth by connecting real creative work to classroom learning.

In this video, faculty member Karumba Ngatia shares how he teaches students to approach their work with full commitment. He encourages them to see their projects as bigger than themselves, as work that could create lasting impact. This mindset helps students give their heart and soul to what they create, whether it’s a film, a design, or a sound project.\n\nNgatia explains that students often struggle when they realise what creative work actually involves. Some arrive with a bit of experience, and others come in expecting a simple process. What helps them move forward is a mental reset. He reminds them that they are young and malleable, and uses personal examples to help them reflect on how much they’ve already changed. Once that shift happens, students begin to engage with their work more seriously and with renewed purpose.\n\nThe video also highlights the kind of learner who grows fastest at ADMI. Students who enter with open minds and little experience often make the biggest leaps. The faculty, made up of part-time professionals who are active in the industry, support this growth by connecting real creative work to classroom learning. Karumba Ngatia’s approach offers an honest look into the values that shape creative education at ADMI and how mindset plays a central role in every student’s journey\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica.",

What really matters is what students do with them. In this video, Karumba Ngatia shares how ADMI trains creatives not just to use equipment, but to create work that has impact. Whether it's through a mic, a lens, or a brush, students are challenged to produce art that means something and moves people.\n\nHe reflects on how departments collaborate, how students grow through real production timelines, and why it's important to talk to classmates outside your course. Karumba also speaks to the role of parents in a student’s journey. He encourages families to invest time, support, and belief. Two years of patience after graduation can make all the difference. Not every career starts fast, but steady growth is powerful.\n\nMore than anything, Karumba reminds students that what they create has the potential to live beyond them. Every poster, film, or design carries a message, and every message has the power to shift something in someone else. That’s the responsibility, and the beauty, of being a creative.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica.",

In this video, she shares how the campus culture is built to support all types of students by offering mentorship, access to resources, and a sense of community. Whether students are outgoing or reserved, they are guided to find their path and explore their full potential.\n\nShe also talks about the strong connection between faculty and students. Lecturers are practicing professionals who teach in class and also work with students on real projects. This approach gives learners direct access to industry experience and builds confidence through practical work. Students are encouraged to spend time on campus, even outside class hours, using the space for rehearsals, production, or collaboration.\n\nThis video offers a look into how ADMI nurtures creativity through structure, support, and freedom to explore. From film and animation to music and design, the environment is set up for students to express themselves, try new ideas, and grow in their craft. Every creative has a place here.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",

It begins with a thorough orientation where students meet faculty, IT support, finance teams, counselors, and student services. They’re introduced to tools like the learning management system and school email, and shown where to find help whenever they need it. Throughout their course, students engage in hands-on projects, attend gigs, and take part in industry events like Nairobi Fashion Week. Weekly activities such as Freshers Friday and open conversations create space for connection, growth, and creativity.\n\nAcademic support is available through accessible faculty, structured systems, and expert-led masterclasses, while mental wellness is prioritized through regular check-ins and events focused on emotional health. Students also have the chance to earn through paid client work and participate in vibrant campus clubs. From orientation to graduation, every step is designed to build confidence, skill, and industry readiness.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/admiafrica/  \nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/school/admiafrica/  \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ADMIAFRICA  \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@admiafrica  \nTwitter/ X - https://x.com/ADMIafrica",
