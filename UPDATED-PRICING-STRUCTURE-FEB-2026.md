## 💬 SALES TALKING POINTS

### Lead with Monthly Payments (Not Total)

**❌ AVOID:**

- "The diploma program costs 500,000 KES"
- "It's a 2-year commitment at 100K per term"

**✅ USE:**

- "You can start your diploma for just 15,000 KES per month"
- "Most students choose our flexible payment plan - 500 KES per day"
- "Think of it as investing 15K/month now to earn 75K/month for life"

### Emphasize Fast Payback

**For Standard Diploma (450K):**

- "You'll pay back your entire investment in just 6 months after graduation"
- "Alumni earn an average of 75,000 KES/month, so your 450K investment pays itself back quickly"

**For GD/Content Diploma (320K):**

- "With starting salaries of 65K/month, you'll recover your 320K investment in just 5 months"
- "Our graduates are earning double their investment within the first year"

### Certificate Comparison (Upsell Opportunity)

**When prospect mentions certificate:**

- "Certificates are great for quick skills, but here's what you should know..."
- "Certificate grads earn 35K/month, diploma grads earn 75K/month"
- "Over 5 years, that's 2.94M KES more in your pocket with a diploma"
- "The diploma costs 402K more, but you earn back 2.94M more - that's a 7.3× return on the upgrade"
