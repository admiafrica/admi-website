# DIPLOMA ENROLLMENT CRISIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Prepared for:** ADMI Leadership Team  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Revenue Recovery

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

- **102 applications received** for recent intake
- **Majority were certificate courses** (low-value programs)
- **Total revenue: < 5M KES** (significantly below target)
- **Root cause:** Marketing attracts wrong student profile

### Revenue Impact

| Scenario | Applications | Revenue (First Semester) | Lifetime Value (2 years) |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------||
| **Current (30% diploma)** | 102 (31 diploma, 71 cert) | 4.4M KES | ~15M KES |
| **Target (70% diploma)** | 102 (71 diploma, 31 cert) | 7.1M KES | ~27M KES |
| **Revenue Gap** | - | -2.7M KES | -12M KES |

**Translation:** We're leaving 12M KES on the table over 2 years due to wrong lead mix.

**Note:** Diplomas = 4 semesters (100K each) + 1 internship (48K) = 450K lifetime (standard) or 320K (GD/Content)

## ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS COMPLETED (Today)

### 1. Lead Scoring System Optimized

**File:** `src/components/forms/EnhancedEnquiryForm.tsx`

- ✅ Investment range adjusted to favor diploma-level budgets
- ✅ Lead score cap raised from 20 to 30 points
- ✅ Conversion tracking updated to reflect true diploma value ($200 vs $10)

## 💰 PROJECTED REVENUE IMPACT

### Conservative Scenario (60% Diploma Rate)

```
Next Intake (March-April 2026):
- 300 total applications
- 180 diploma applications (60%)
- 45 diploma enrollments (25% conversion)

Revenue:
- First term: 45 × 145K = 6.525M KES
- Lifetime: 45 × 750K avg = 33.75M KES
```

### Target Scenario (75% Diploma Rate)

```
Next Intake (March-April 2026):
- 300 total applications
- 225 diploma applications (75%)
- 63 diploma enrollments (28% conversion)

Revenue:
- First term: 63 × 145K = 9.135M KES
- Lifetime: 63 × 750K avg = 47.25M KES
```

### 🎯 Goal: **10M+ KES per intake** (vs current <5M KES)

---

## 🔑 SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Lead Quality Over Quantity

- **Stop chasing volume** → Focus on diploma-ready leads
- **Pre-qualify finances** → Can they afford 725K-870K program?
- **Target career-changers** → Not hobbyists or casual learners

### 2. Clear Value Proposition

- **Salary messaging** → "Earn 60K-120K KES/month after graduation"
- **ROI focus** → "Pay back your investment in 10 months"
- **Career outcomes** → "85% employed within 3 months"

### 3. Remove Friction

- **Payment plans** → "Just 24,000 KES/month" (not "750K total")
- **Scholarships** → "50 scholarships available this intake"
- **Flexible schedules** → "Study while working"
